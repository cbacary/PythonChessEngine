# Chess-Engnine

This is a chess engine that is pretty simple. Only calculation it does is a minimax search with alpha-beta pruning. There are still various bugs.

Only requirements are numpy, pygame, and python-chess.

pip3 install pygame

pip3 install numpy

pip3 install chess

# To run it

python3 GUI.py

or however you run python files

# Issues?

If you run into any issues, post something on the Issues page and I'll see if I can resolve it, or create a Pull Request.

# Notes

There is a Unity port also on my github.

Also note the python-chess library does already have a engine built in. I am not using it because that sort of defeats the entire purpose of this fun project.
